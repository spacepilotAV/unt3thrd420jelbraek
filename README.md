# unt3thrd420jelbraek
coming soon ;) supported=10+>13.5.5b1 except 13.5.1

## fun shit
* 1 public unt3thr (based off of https://github.com/w212security/wenetaunthreader, thx to teh rest of my team)

* 1 private-ish unt3thr (i mean, some of the code is public, but it requires quite a bit of knowledge on enterprise shit to get functional @ https://github.com/w212security/wenetaunthreader/tree/experimental_SAM)

* (maybe, very fuckin maybe) 1 VERY-DA-VERY-SERIOUSLY-VERY private unt3thr (no code public) (outdated & depreceated APIs are fun! except when every exploit panicks. :( )
